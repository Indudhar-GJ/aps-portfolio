                        <h3>1. Detecting high volume transation clusters.</h3>
                        <p>Data Structure/Algorithm used : Graph</p>
                        <p>Creating a graph of transactions and running DFS to identify clusters of accounts that have
                            high transaction volumes among them.Using graph data structures, where nodes represent
                            accounts and edges represent transactions. Algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) can be
                            used to detect cycles and high volume transaction patterns.</p>
                        <p>Challenges : Need to build the graph first ,which takes lot of time and storage. </p>

                        <p>Data Structure/Algorithm used : Hash Tables</p>
                        <p>Utilizing hash tables for storing and retrieving transaction records, user data, and other
                            frequently accessed information.Where transaction ID is stored as keys and transaction
                            details
                            as values in a hash table, allowing O(1) average time complexity for lookups.Hence
                            reduces the time required to access critical data, enhancing customer service.</p>
                        <p>Challenges : Need to handle collisions , may take more space inorder to handle the
                            collisions.</p>

                        <p>Data Structure/Algorithm used : Trie</p>
                        <p>We can use trie data structures to store and search card numbers, ensuring quick validation
                            and retrieval of data.Store card numbers in a trie, where each digit is a node. This allows
                            for faster lookup and prefix matching, which can be used in validating card numbers and
                            detecting invalid card entries.It improves the speed and accuracy of validating card
                            transactions.</p>

                        <p>Data Structure/Algorithm used : Radix Tree</p>
                        <p>Using Radix Tree we can perform faster insertion, deletion, and lookup of
                            transactions details. Also we can use a Radix to maintain a sorted list of transactions
                            based
                            on transaction time or amount, enabling efficient retrieval and updates.</p>

                        <p>Data Structure/Algorithm used : Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</p>
                        <p> Visa is a huge company and has a large database and if it want to search for a specific
                            account/user/transaction it would take a lot of time.So we can use Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
                            algorithm for fast pattern matching in strings.
                            We can use the KMP algorithm to search for specific account in transactions/database and
                            retreive the information.</p>
                        <p>Challenges : The preprocessing of data is required. </p>

                        <p>Visa can use Kadane's algorithm to detect periods of high spending in transaction data snd
                            with the help of this Visa can rent out more servers before hand ,so that transaction do not

                        <p>Quick and reliable transaction is one of the motive of Visa Cards. Therefore the Account
                            balance of both the parties has to be updated with the new balance within seconds.So we can
                            use persistent segment trees to update the balance of accounts.Using segment trees
                            reduces the time to update
                            the balances. We can traverse the data down the tree when the user views the balance.</p>

                        <p>Visa can use Union-Find to manage groups of users who are connected through various criteria,
                            such as geographical locations, transaction patterns, or membership in loyalty programs.
                            This helps in targeting marketing campaigns more effectively.</p>

                        <p>Visa has a variety of cards, the more premium cards has to be given more priority because
                            their contribute more to the profit of the company than others and frequency and volume of
                            the transaction is higher.
                            Higher ranked cards can be given priority for transaction when there are huge amount of
                            requesting coming.</p>
                        <p>Challenges : Insertion and deletion operation require rebalancing, which requires a lot of

                        <h3>10. Network resource utilization</h3>
                        <p>Data Structure/Algorithm used : Ford-Fulkerson</p>
                        <p> A transaction needs to be completed without delay and failures, so the load on server as to
                            be distributed equally. Even if one server fails then the transaction has to be completed by
                            another server with least load. The trust of merchant and customer plays a huge in growth of
                            the company.
                            To acheive this we can use Max flow algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson which can
                            help assist load balancing across servers and minimize network congestion.
                            The network is
                            abstracted as a graph with capacities assigned to the edges. The Max flow algorithm finds
                            the optimal flow path that maximizes throughput at minimum cost. However, the capacities
                            need to be updated dynamically (real-time).</p>

                        <p>Around 65000 transaction happen every second and the each transaction must be completed
                            within seconds of their initiation. The time required to get and send data to the servers
                            contribute to the major time of the whole transaction time. Find from what time to what time
                            do the most number of transactions happen using Kadane's
                            Algorithm so that you can optimize the servers to handle the load.</p>

                        <p>As discussed above the duration of a transaction is very crucial for user for
