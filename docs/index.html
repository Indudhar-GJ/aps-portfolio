                        <p>Data Structure/Algorithm used : Graph</p>
                        <p>Creating a graph of transactions and running DFS to identify clusters of accounts that have
                            high transaction volumes among them.Using graph data structures, where nodes represent
                            accounts and edges represent transactions. Algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) can be

                        <p>We can use trie data structures to store and search card numbers, ensuring quick validation
                            and retrieval of data.Store card numbers in a trie, where each digit is a node. This allows
                            for faster lookup and prefix matching, which can be used in validating card numbers and
                            detecting invalid card entries.It improves the speed and accuracy of validating card
                            transactions.</p>

                        <h3>11. Network resource utilization</h3>
                        <p>Data Structure/Algorithm used : Ford-Fulkerson</p>
                        <p> A transaction needs to be completed without delay and failures, so the load on server as to
                            be distributed equally. Even if one server fails then the transaction has to be completed by
                            another server with least load. The trust of merchant and customer plays a huge in growth of
                            the company.
                            To acheive this we can use Max flow algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson which can
                            help assist load balancing across servers and minimize network congestion.
                            The network is
                            abstracted as a graph with capacities assigned to the edges. The Max flow algorithm finds
                            the optimal flow path that maximizes throughput at minimum cost. However, the capacities
                            need to be updated dynamically (real-time).</p>

                        <p>We can use Huffman coding compression algorithm ,so that the data transmission time
                            gets reduced by decreasing the time to transfer the card infrmation between the customer
                            bank server and the merchent bank server.</p>

                        <p>We can use Bloom filter algorithm for checking if a card is blocked, expired, blacklisted
                            before you begin a transaction.If
                            not, then you can continue with transaction else you can cancel the transaction.</p>

                        <p>Visa gives rewards and offers on thier card to increase the usage of their cards and hence
                            increase their profit. To make the customers use their cards more frequently we can use a
                            version of Kadane's Algorithm to find the period of the year when they use their card the
                            least and hence give offers during that time period.</p>

                        <p>Data Structure/Algorithm used : K-D Trees</p>
                        <p>It is important to complete the transaction within seconds and to acheive this the data
                            between the server and local machine should be quick. Hence, storing the data in appropriate
                            locations would enchance the chance of a successful and quick transaction. to acheive this
                            we can use KD trees to select the server based on locations where the cards were used
                            historically. </p>
